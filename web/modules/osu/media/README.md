# Media

The OSU media module set is designed to include packages 
that define reusable aspects of media handling.

Functionality goes here when it...

* creates styles that govern how media will be rendered (image presets, bundles, crops).
* general aspects of media handling integration (maybe a browser?)

## Planned Components

* crops - collections of crops
* ??? - to be determined 
* profit!
