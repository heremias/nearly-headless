## For Official OSU Business (by employees)

The intent of these modules is to help create a reuseable ecosystem
for university marketing to draw upon. The development team is pro-reuse
and con support. IE, take what you want but don't expect support. We may
eventually release more supported versions of this software.

## Non OSU Business

* Getting approval to license things under GPL/BSD/etc is complex.
* It's probably ok to take "fair use" style examples.
* It's not ok to fork the project and start running a clone of everything.
