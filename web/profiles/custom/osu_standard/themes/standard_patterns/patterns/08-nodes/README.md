# Nodes

All nodes are Drupal nodes. We separate them here
to encourage consistent treatment, make them easier to talk about
within Pattern Lab, and so its easier for backend folks to stub
things out. 

The actual patterns for these things can be implemented anywhere, 
but the more consistent we make things the better.

We have many view modes for nodes and our node patterns are organized by
view mode to encourage consistency.

* Full - a full page view.
* Teaser - Usually a narrow and short view. Inconsistent, not commonly used.
* Large - Meant to be a wide, but short representation of a node.
