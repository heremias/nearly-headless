# Components

All components are Drupal paragraphs. We separate them here
to encourage consistent treatment and make them easier to talk about
within Pattern Lab.

The actual patterns for these things can be implemented anywhere, 
but the more consistent we make things the better.

At this point in time, all our paragraphs have only one view mode (default)
so we categorize them by how and where they are used.

* Floors - 100% width of site w\fields for width, heading, heading level, intro, cta.
* Sections - Large width components with heading + heading level.
* Cards - Things that look and feel like cards.
* Heroes - 100% width things used in the hero space.
* Components - Everything else, but mostly components used in narrow columns.
