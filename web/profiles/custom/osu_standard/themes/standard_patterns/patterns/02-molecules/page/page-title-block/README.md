# Page Title Block
This pattern defines the look of a page's title block (and the title therein).
Designs call for this to be rendered as a 100% width grey box with about an 
inch of height in desktop.

## Drupal

Drupal will pass in a "content" variable for the contents of the block.
That content is rendered using the _page-title.twig helper found in this
pattern so it should generally match whatever the pattern outputs.

## Pattern Lab

Uses the _page-title.twig helper to render directly.
