# Introduction

An introduction is potentially rich formatted text appearing at the top
of a page or other type of content.

Drupal and pattern lab receive the same input in both cases, a "content" 
variable which may or may not include formatted text.

# Caveat

We don't have a way to communicate/model the variant with an image
so lets pretend it doesn't exist at first.
