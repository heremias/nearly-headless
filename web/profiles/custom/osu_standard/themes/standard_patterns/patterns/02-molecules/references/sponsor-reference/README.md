# Sponsor 

Sponsors are taxonomy terms. Presently, they
have a website field and may end up having more
fields in the future.

A "reference" rendering is a, normally compact,
version of a taxonomy term with whatever information
is most important to be shown when the term is 
referenced.

In this case, it's is just a link.
