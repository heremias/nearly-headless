# Address
Display different forms of addresses using data from a Drupal address field.

Address fields are fairly complex in that they can represent
addresses in any country.

## Caveat

I've included a template here for simplicity, but with 
full internationalization, we may need to ditch the 
template approach. The upstream module did this saying that
some forms of addresses couldn't be represented in a
template.
