# Location Reference

Locations are taxonomy terms with several fields.
* label/name - the name of the term "Hitchcock 101" or "Colubmus Convention Center"
* building - name / code for a campus building (if on campus).
* address - a full drupal address


A "reference" rendering is a, normally compact,
version of a taxonomy term with whatever information
is most important to be shown when the term is 
referenced.

In this case, there's two versions.

* Campus (label / directions link)
* Non-Campus (label / full-ish address / directions link)
