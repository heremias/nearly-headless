# Core Menu Block
This pattern defines the look of a page's primary navigation.

## Drupal

Drupal will pass in a "content" variable for the contents of the block.
That content is rendered using the _menu.twig helper found in this
pattern.

## Pattern Lab

Uses static html to mock the menu. I made it match the output of the
twig include. It would probably be better to make some sample data
so they are necessarily running off the same template.
